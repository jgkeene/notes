# Q: What exactly is a lambda?

# A: It's an inline function, with 1 expression, that gets evaluated when the function is called.
#    Lambdas have the form:        lambda ARGUMENTS : EXPRESSION

# All lambdas functions can be re-writen as a standard function.

f = lambda x,y : x+y

f(2,2)
    4

def f(x,y):
    return x+y

f(2,2)
4
