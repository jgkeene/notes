Chapter 2: “Workflow Steps”
===========================

1. Capture

   -  capture ALL “open loops” into “buckets” in the INBOX
   -  buckets: (email) (loose papers) (digital notes)
   -  you must have as few “buckets” as possible
   -  items must leave INBOX and never returns to INBOX again
   -  (you must empty it daily)

2. Clarify

   -  Actionable?

      -  No

         -  “Someday” list (review weekly, try to move things to Trash)
         -  References
         -  Trash
         -  Remind Me Later

      -  Yes (<2min, just do it)

         -  “Projects” list
         -  “Next Actions” list (do as soon as possible)
         -  Calender (items that must be completed on a specific
            date&time)
         -  “Waiting For” list

3. Organize

   -  We only need to track:

      -  calendar
      -  “Next Actions”
      -  “Waiting For”

4. Reflect

   -  **Daily** review, in this order:

      1. Calendar (review daily, for hardline stuff)
      2. “Next Actionis” list (review whenever you’re available)
      3. “Projects” lists , “Someday” lists , “Waiting For” lists
         (review as often as you see fit)

   -  **Weekly** review:

      1. ALL “Projects”
      2. ALL lists:

         -  update lists
         -  review entire system/workflow

5. Engage

   -  3 types of work to do:

      1. doing predefined work - working on “Next Actions” lists, or
         Calendar
      2. doing work as it shows up (ad hoc)
      3. defining your work

         -  clearing INBOX
         -  notes
         -  break new projects into smaller steps (divide and conquer)
         -  identifying things that need to be done in the future

   -  6 levels to reviewing your own work:

      -  lvl5 - life’s purpose
      -  lvl4 - 3-5yr vision
      -  lvl3 - 1-2yr goals
      -  lvl2 - areas of focus (*ex:finances,health,degree,etc.*)
      -  lvl1 - current “Projects” list
      -  Ground - current “Next Actions” list

--------------

Chapter 3: “Project Plan”
=========================

-  keys to GTD are clearly defined:

   1. ``outcomes`` (for projects) & ``next actions`` (to move things
      along)
   2. ``reminders`` (reviewed regularly)

5 Steps To Planning A Project
-----------------------------

1. Define ``purpose`` (*why*)

   -  *“What’s my purpose doing this?”*
   -  benefits:

      -  motivates (gives the reason for doing something)
      -  creates decision-making criteria (helps you decide things)
      -  defines success, aligns resources, clarifies focus, it expands
         options

2. Envision the ``outcome`` (*what*) (*a very powerful lifeskill*)

   -  *“What will the project look like when it’s done?”*
   -  *“Where will you be in your career in 3 years?”*
   -  *“What web app would you create if it could be anything you
      wanted?”*
   -  *“Wouldn’t it be great if…” (a good way to start thinking about an
      outcome)*
   -  keys:

      -  define (and redefine) what you’re trying to accomplish on many
         different levels
      -  reallocate resources to getting those tasks done

3. ``Brainstorming`` (*how*)

   -  Good for capturing original ideas, and generating new ones
   -  Empty your head and capture and express any idea, and then later
      figure out how it fits in and what to do with it
   -  Tools to use are whiteboard/mindmap/colors
   -  keys:

      -  go for **quantity** over quality

4. ``Organizing``

   -  process:

      -  identify significant parts
      -  sort parts by priority, sequence, or component
      -  add detail to parts as needed

   -  Tools to use are Gantt-type chart, stages and milestones

5. Identifying ``next actions``

   -  *“Is there something I could do now for this task?”*

Chapter 4 Getting Started: “Coralling Your Stuff”
=================================================

-  Goal is to ``capture`` everything that has your attention
-  ypically takes a couple hours

Step 1: “Physical Gathering”
----------------------------

-  Our goal is to gather anything that:

   -  doesn’t belong there? needs action? anything you’d like to change?

-  Things that don’t go in INBOX are: supplies, reference material,
   equipment
-  If it’s too big to fit in INBOX, put post-it not on it
-  Trash anything if you can

1. Go around *work desk* -> *drawers* -> *room*
2. Ask yourself if you have any intention of changing anything?
3. If so, make note about it, place in INBOX

Step 2: “Mental Gathering”
--------------------------

-  Write down any idea or thing in your mind that that’s grabbing your
   attention on a *seperate sheet of papaer*
-  Use “Trigger” List (pg 116) to jog mind and come up with more things

-  Trash anything if you can

--------------

Chapter 6 ``Clarifying``: Getting “In” to Empty
===============================================

-  Processing rules for the INBOX:

   -  process TOP item first, one at a time

      -  ? What action is required? *“What’s the ***precise physical***
         ‘Next Action’?”*

   -  NEVER put something back into INBOX

-  If actionable it goes into one of three categories:

   1. Do it
   2. Defer it
   3. Delegate it

-  If non-actionable it goes into one of three categories:

   1. Trash
   2. Someday
   3. Reference

Projects
--------

-  Shift your perspective to the larger (multi-step) picture - your
   projects

--------------

Chapter 7 ``Organizing``: Setting up ’Buckets
=============================================

Basic Categories
----------------

+----------------+------------------+----------+
| LISTS          | ASSETS           | OTHER    |
+================+==================+==========+
| “Next Actions” | References       | calendar |
+----------------+------------------+----------+
| “Projects”     | Project material | asdf     |
+----------------+------------------+----------+
| “Someday”      |                  |
+----------------+------------------+----------+
| “Waiting       |                  |
+----------------+------------------+----------+

-  Organizing “Next Actions” by ontent

   -  There are some things that have to be done ASAP
   -  This list should be placed near the computer
   -  Some common categories:

      -  “Calls”, “At Computer”, “Errands”, “At Office”, “At Home”,
         “Agendas”, “Read/ Review”

-  Organizing “Waiting For”

   -  It is a list of everything that other people are supposed to be
      doing.
   -  (review every 2 days)

-  Project Lists
-  Projected Support Materials
-  Reference Materials
-  “Someday” Lists

--------------

Chapter 8 ``Reflecting``: Keeping Your System Functional
========================================================

What to Look At and When
------------------------

-  First thing to look at is your calendar since it is the most time
   sensitive.
-  This will probably be your most frequent review.
-  Next, is your action lists. This is to check the list of all the
   actions you could be doing in your present context.
-  If your calendar is trustworthy and your action lists are current,
   these may be the only things you’ll need to refer to more than every
   couple of days.

Updating Your System
--------------------

-  It is difficult to be productive and get things done when your lists
   are out-of-date.
-  It is imperative to update your system.

The Power of the Weekly Review
------------------------------

-  The weekly review is doing whatever it is you need to do to get your
   head empty again.
-  It’s going through the five phases of workflow management-
   collecting, processing, organizing, and reviewing all your
   outstanding involvements.
-  You know you’re done when you can honestly say,”I absolutely know
   right now everything I’m not doing but could be doing if I decided
   to”
-  This can be done at any time you can block off at least two hours to
   review and update your system.
-  This could be on a Friday afternoon at the end of the workweek or on
   long commutes home.

Chapter 9 ``Engaging``: Making the Best Action Choices
======================================================

There are 3 concepts when deciding on work
------------------------------------------

1) choosing next actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    1. Context - what could you possibly do where you are with the tools you have at the moment?
    2. Time available - How much time do you have before you have to do something else?
    3. Energy available - How much energy do you have at the moment, how much energy does the task require?
    4. Priority - What is the most important thing for me to do? 

2) types of daily work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    1. Doing Predefined work
    2. Doing work as it shows up
    3. Defining your work

3) levels of overall importance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    1. 50,000 + feet: Life
    2. 40,000 + feet: Three to Five Year Visions
    3. 30,000+ feet: One-to-two year goals
    4. 20,000+ feet: Areas of Responsibility
    5. 10,000+ feet: Current Projects
    6. Runway: Current actions

``Many times, people are stressed out and distracted in life.``

--------------

Chapter 10 Getting Projects Under Control
=========================================

Which Projects Should Be Planning?
----------------------------------

1. Projects that still have your attention after you’ve determined their
   next actions
2. Projects about which potentially useful ideas and supportive detail
   just show up

How Do I Apply All This In My World?
------------------------------------

-  You need to keep your “Projects” list as up to date as your “Next
   Actions” list.
-  The key is to get comfortable with having and using your ideas.
-  It is acquiring the habit of focusing your energy constructively on
   intended outcomes and open loops before you have to.

--------------

Chapter 11: The Power of This Program
=====================================

Practical reasons to do this shit:
----------------------------------

-  Keeps your mind distraction-free,
-  Ensuring a high level of efficiency and effectiveness in your work
   and in your life ### Psychological reasons to do this shit:
-  Many times, people are stressed out and distracted in life.
-  In some cases, they may even be disgusted or disappointed in
   themselves for not doing the things they said they were going to do.
-  This system offers a way for you to stop breaking those subconscious
   agreements with yourself, and start feeling good and in control
   again.

--------------

Chapter 12: The Power of the Next- Action Decision
==================================================

-  The power of the question, “So what is the next action?” is
   extraordinary.
-  Just deciding what the next step in achieving a goal is can be
   extremely empowering and stress-reducing.
-  The Value of a Next-Action Decision-Making Standard

   1. Clarity - Knowing exactly what it is you’re suppose to do next.
   2. Accountability - Knowing exactly whose responsibility the action
      is.
   3. Productivity - Companies naturally become more productive under
      this model.
   4. Empowerment - It dramatically increases your ability to make
      things happen with a concomitant rise in your self-esteem and
      constructive outlook.

--------------

Chapter 13: The Power of Outcome
================================

-  Focusing There is a sense of control, and power Empowerment naturally
   results for individuals as they move from complaining/victim
   modalities into outcomes and actions defined for direction.
-  There is a sense of control, and power.
-  It is a source of positive energy and focus. Over the years, it is
   becoming clear that positive projection of results can greatly
   influence actions and therefore outcomes.
